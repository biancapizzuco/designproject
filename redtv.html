    <h1>Red (Taylor's Version)</h1>
    <p class="text">"Red" was Taylor's fourth studio album. It was also the second album of hers that she re-recorded. It was released on November 12th, 2021. The album includes 20 tracks as well as nine vault tracks, including the famous "All Too Well (10-minute version)". This album contained a few more pop songs compared to Taylor's usual country music. Taylor explained this album as "Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I'm not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way."</p>
